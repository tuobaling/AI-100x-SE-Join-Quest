Feature: E-commerce Order Pricing Promotions
  As a shopper
  I want the system to calculate my order total with applicable promotions
  So that I can understand how much to pay and what items I will receive

  Scenario: Single product without promotions
    Given no promotions are applied
    When a customer places an order with:
      | productName | quantity | unitPrice |
      | T-shirt     | 1        | 500       |
    Then the order summary should be:
      | totalAmount |
      | 500         |
    And the customer should receive:
      | productName | quantity |
      | T-shirt     | 1        |
